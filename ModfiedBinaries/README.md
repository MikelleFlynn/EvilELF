# Warning: Malicious Files Detected

## This folder contains files that have been flagged as potentially malicious or harmful to your computer and data. These files may pose a significant risk to the security and integrity of your system.

## Cautionary Advice: Use Virtual Machines

To minimize the potential risks associated with these files, we strongly advise that you consider using virtual machines (VMs) when working with the contents of this folder. Virtual machines provide an isolated environment that can help protect your main system from potential threats.

## Here are some important reasons to consider using a virtual machine:

### Isolation: VMs create a separate environment from your host operating system, making it more difficult for malicious files to affect your primary system.

Snapshot and Restore: VMs allow you to take snapshots of the system before running potentially harmful files. If something goes wrong, you can easily restore the VM to its previous state.

Testing and Analysis: You can safely analyze and test these files within a controlled environment. If they turn out to be safe, you can confidently transfer them to your main system.

## #Limited Impact: Any damage caused by malicious files within a virtual machine is contained within that environment and does not affect your main computer.

To set up a virtual machine, you can use software like VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V, depending on your operating system. Make sure to follow best practices for security when configuring and using virtual machines.

# Exercise extreme caution when handling files from this folder, and do not open them directly on your primary system. Using a virtual machine adds an extra layer of protection and helps ensure the safety of your computer and data.

Please proceed with care and take all necessary precautions to safeguard your system while working with these files.
